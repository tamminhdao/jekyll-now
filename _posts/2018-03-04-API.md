API stands for Application Programming Interface. In a server, the API is the part that receives requests and sends responses. To "make API calls" == "to send an http request".     
Whenever we need to get some data from a website (i.e. a company), our first solution would be to check if the company provides an API. Most large companies have APIs to provide clients with the information they need.
This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY>video</a> offers a great explanation of API, so does <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82>this aritcle</a>.

When clients send requests to a server, they send these requests to the API endpoints. Endpoints are predefined routes in the server. The term "endpoint" is effectively a fancy name for an url. 

The response to an API call can be formatted in JSON - JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is just text that looks like a collection of key-value pairs. It uses JavaScript syntax, hence the term "JavaScript" is embeded in its name. Despite this, JSON is completely language independent. It is a data serialization format. Other well-known formats are XML and YAML.
