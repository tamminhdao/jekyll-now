title: RESTful APIs
---

API stands for Application Programming Interface. There are two types of APIs - REST and SOAP. In this post, we focus on learning about REST APIs. In a server, the API is the part that receives requests and sends responses. It is the point of entry for clients to obtain resources from the server. Whenever we need to get some data from a website (i.e. a company), our first solution would be to check if the company provides an API. Most large companies have APIs to provide clients with the information they need. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style. RESTful APIs are commonly used in the development of web services. They are based on URLs and follow HTTP protocols. To "make API calls" is in essence to send an http request (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE). When clients send requests to a server, they send these requests to the API endpoints. Endpoints are predefined routes in the server. The term "endpoint" is effectively a fancy name for an url.

The response to an API call is often formatted in JSON - JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is just text that looks like a collection of key-value pairs. It uses JavaScript syntax, hence the term "JavaScript" is embedded in its name. Despite this, JSON is completely language independent. It is a data serialization format. Other well-known formats are XML and YAML. Using JSON as its data format makes RESTful APIs highly compatible with browsers. JSON is compact, light-weight and interface well with JS-based web apps. This is one of the advantages of using RESTful APIs for web services.

In order to be considered RESTful, an API must conform to certain criteria, one of which is the client-server architectural constrain. This constrain addresses separation of concerns. RESTful APIs facilitate client-server communication and architecture, which allow the client application and the server application to evolve independently. Perhaps, this is why REST is good for scalability.
