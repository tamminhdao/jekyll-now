title: The Interface Segregation Principle (SOLID series)
---
ISP stated that clients should not be forced to depend upon methods that they do not use. Interface belongs to clients, not to hierarchies.

The story: Implement different game types for tictactoe, Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer. 
In order to do this, it is useful to create a Player interface and every type of player, human, smart AI, dumb AI should all conform to this interface.

This is one such interface I wrote in my first version of tictactoe in Java

```
public interface Player {
    String getSymbol();
    int obtainValidCellSelection();
    void addSymbol(String symbol);
    void addOpponentSymbol(String opponentSymbol);
    void addRules(Rules rules);
}
```

This interface is considered a "fat" interface and violates ISP. This interface has methods that only the AI player needs to calculate its next move. The AI needs to know about the rules, and the opponent's symbol, but the Human Player does not need these methods. In this case, Human Player is forced to implement addOpponentSymbol() and addRules() even though it does not use the information. 

One solution to this "fat" interface problem is to split that interface into multiple smaller interfaces and have our classes conform to one or more interfaces depends on their needs. In this case, that means separate the Player interface into a Player interface and an AI interface

```
public interface Player {
    String getSymbol();
    int obtainValidCellSelection();
}

public interface AI {
    void addSymbol(String symbol);
    void addOpponentSymbol(String opponentSymbol);
    void addRules(Rules rules);
}

public class HumanPlayer implements Player {
	@Override
	public String getSymbol() {}

	@Override
	public int obtainValidCellSelection() {}	
}

public class AIPlayer implements AI, Player {

	@Override
	public String getSymbol() {}

	@Override
	public int obtainValidCellSelection() {}	

	@Override
	void AddSymbol() {}

	@Override
	void addOpponentSymbol() {}

	@Override
	void addRules() {}
}
```

The HumanPlayer class now does not need to implement AI methods anymore. This solution solved the violation of ISP in our code.
